Why do we migrate from POPS to OOPS?
	1) Because of security.
	In POPS anybody can access all the functions, hence there is no security.
	But in OOPS, if we want to access members of a class, we have to create an object.
	2) OOPs is used to develop real time applications easily.

		OOPs:
Defn:-
	A program is divided into collection of objects.
	It is used for security,reusability,extensability, reducing complexity and human understandability.

Concepts of OOPS:-
classes&objects
Data abstraction
Data encapsulation
Inheritance
Polymorphism

Class & objects
	" Class is a logical entity. "
	Class is a collection of data members and member functions into a single unit.
	"Object is a physical entity(real time entity)."
	Object is an instance(memory initialization) of a class.
	Every object has its own memory location and every object has lot of properties and lot of functions.

Data abstraction
	since members are defined within a class they've abstracted.
	It is used to reduce the complexity of coding.
	Members can be accessed by someone without knowledge of how they're functioned.

Data Encapsulation
	Since members are wrapped and covered by a class,they're more secure.

Inheritance
	To create a new class from an existing class.
	Reusability and extensability.
	Common properties are derived from base class.

Polymorphism(many forms)
	It means that one interface,multiple actions.
	It is used for common class of actions.
	Common methods are used.


Note:-
	Accoring to object we've two types of languages.
such as,
1.Object based programming language.
	There are only class,obj,abstraction and encapsulation. There are no inheritance and polymorphism.
eg:
	VB,ASP
2.Object oriented programming language.
	It is an object based programming with inheritance and polymorphism.
eg:
	C++,Java,Dotnet
